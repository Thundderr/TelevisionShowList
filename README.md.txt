Project Title: TelevisionShowList
By: Aiden Smith

The goal of this application is to create a list of shows so that you can track what you have watched.
By clicking on each show, you will be able to add the specifics of a show onto your list. You will be able 
to specify the name of the show, if you have finished watching it, and finally if you recommend the show 
to other people. The latter two will result in icons popping up on the menu. When performing actions with 
the application, toasts will pop up when certain parts of the app are triggered, such as clicking on a show on the list. 
The application will also consist of icons to demonstrate the specifics of each checkbox in each show, having 
icons for if you have finished a show as well as an icon for if you recommend it.

Project Title: TelevisionShowList
By: Aiden Smith

The goal of this application is to create a list of shows that you can edit to track what you have watched.
Many parts of the application can be accessed through fragments, providing more insight into each component.
Once a show is clicked, a menu will pop up that displays the details of the show, including name, date, and
if you have watched and would recommend the show. The name can be altered in this menu, while watched/recommended
can be toggled by check boxes within the menu. The date can be changed by clicking the date button and opening a
date selector menu. Each of these actions will result in a toast describing the action you are performing. Once
you exit to the main list, you will see that the show you edited will have either their name changed, or the icons
for watched (a green circle) or recommended (a telephone) toggled if those options had been selected. The date will
also be updated to what the user selected. Within each individual show menu, you can also select the time including
hours, minutes, and AM/PM, although this will only show up within the show fragment. This app can be rotated within 
any menu you want as well. The app also comes with a nice green/black theme that is present throughout each menu.
